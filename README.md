    .\Instance_generator [number-of-vertexes]

Batch commands to compile and run Optimal version (you need proper version of MinGW to run it):
    g++ Optimal_algorithm.cpp -o Optimal_algorithm.exe -fopenmp -O3
    for serial processing:
        .\Optimal_algorithm.exe -serial
    for parallel processing:
        .\Optimal_algorithm.exe
